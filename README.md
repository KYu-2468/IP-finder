### Queries

Check out ([src/schema.ts])schema.ts for supported graphQL queries.
Check out ([src/resolvers.ts])resolvers.ts for supported graphQL queries.

#### How to add a new GraphQL query?

1. Create your queries inside `src/schema.ts` and `src/resolvers.ts`, say you want to create a new route to serve foods

Schema.ts -

```ts
// Tells graphQL what end points are available

type Query {
    ...
    // creates a food end point that will take in an input food name and return a string.
    food(foodName: String!): String
}
```

Resolvers.ts -

```ts
// Tells graphQL how to handle those requests/queries

export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    food(_: any, { foodName }: { foodName: String }) {
      // invoke some functions to get food data
      return "Some data";
    },
  },
};
```
